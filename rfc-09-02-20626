# Submission: Feedback on RFC — Electronic Trade Documents & Control Framework

## 1. Executive Summary

This submission provides feedback on the RFC’s proposed framework for compliant electronic trade documents, control/ownership tracking, and interoperability across trade ecosystem participants. The RFC represents a significant step toward digitization of trade processes; however, several architectural assumptions related to control, interoperability, trust sovereignty, and cryptographic longevity require clarification to ensure long-term legal enforceability, ecosystem interoperability, and national trade resilience.

## 2. Control and Ownership Model

### Observation
The RFC introduces the concept of digital control as the functional equivalent of possession but does not define how control is determined or validated across independent platforms or when parties operate outside a single system.

### Reasoning
Electronic trade documents must remain transferable across multiple systems and organizational boundaries. Without a standardized mechanism for asserting and verifying control, platforms may maintain incompatible representations of ownership, leading to ambiguity during transfers or disputes.

### Risk
- Multiple platforms may simultaneously claim valid control over the same document.
- Courts and customs authorities may lack a consistent evidentiary standard.
- Cross-platform transfers may fail operationally or legally.

### Recommendation
- Define interoperable control attestations.
- Require verifiable, timestamped event logs for all control transfers.
- Specify minimum governance and audit requirements for systems asserting control.

## 3. Interoperability Between Platforms

### Observation
The RFC promotes technology neutrality but does not define interoperability mechanisms between electronic trade document platforms or identity providers.

### Reasoning
Trade ecosystems inherently involve multiple vendors, ports, financial institutions, and logistics providers. Interoperability cannot emerge organically without common protocol expectations and identity translation standards.

### Risk
- Platform fragmentation leading to vendor lock-in.
- Increased onboarding costs for exporters and financial institutions.
- Reduced adoption due to incompatible ecosystems.

### Recommendation
- Publish a canonical interoperability profile.
- Define cross-provider identity and credential exchange standards.
- Establish baseline message and event schemas for document exchange.

## 4. Governance and Compliance

### Observation
The RFC does not clearly define governance responsibilities or liability models for entities operating control registries or electronic document systems.

### Reasoning
Digital trade documents function as legally enforceable instruments. Governance clarity is required to determine responsibility when incorrect control assertions or system failures occur.

### Risk
- Unclear liability during disputes.
- Reduced confidence among banks and insurers.
- Regulatory uncertainty slowing ecosystem adoption.

### Recommendation
- Define operator responsibilities for registries and platforms.
- Establish audit and compliance obligations.
- Clarify liability allocation for incorrect control assertions.

## 5. Trust Sovereignty and Location Neutrality

### Observation
The RFC permits location-neutral trust anchors and trust service providers without explicit jurisdictional anchoring.

### Reasoning
Electronic trade documents derive legal validity from national legal systems and customs enforcement authorities. Allowing trust providers outside jurisdictional oversight introduces enforceability ambiguity and weakens sovereign regulatory control.

### Risk
- Domestic courts may lack authority over foreign trust operators.
- Regulatory arbitrage through low-compliance jurisdictions.
- National trade infrastructure becomes dependent on external trust systems.

### Recommendation
- Require jurisdictionally anchored trust roots or formal cross-recognition frameworks.
- Define criteria for recognition of external trust providers.
- Establish sovereign trust lists recognized by customs authorities.

## 6. Signature Sovereignty

### Observation
The RFC does not clarify how signature validity is determined across jurisdictions or how revocation and compromise are handled when signing authorities are external.

### Reasoning
Electronic transferable records depend on legally recognized signatures tied to authoritative identities. Cross-border verification requires clear authority and dispute resolution mechanisms.

### Risk
- Conflicting signature validation outcomes between jurisdictions.
- Difficulty invalidating compromised credentials.
- Reduced evidentiary reliability in legal proceedings.

### Recommendation
- Introduce a federated trust framework with mutually recognized national trust lists.
- Define cross-border revocation and dispute handling procedures.
- Require jurisdictionally recognized attestations for control transfers.

## 7. Post-Quantum Cryptographic Resilience

### Observation
The RFC does not address cryptographic longevity despite trade documents requiring retention periods often spanning 7–20 years.

### Reasoning
Current public-key cryptographic systems may become vulnerable to future quantum computing advances. Long-lived documents risk loss of evidentiary validity if signatures become breakable.

### Risk
- Retroactive invalidation of archived documents.
- Legal disputes over authenticity of historical trade records.
- Expensive future migration efforts without planned cryptographic agility.

### Recommendation
- Mandate cryptographic agility requirements.
- Support hybrid classical and post-quantum signature schemes.
- Define migration and re-signing procedures for long-lived documents.

---

## 8. Control Registry Neutrality vs Sovereign Oversight

### Observation
The RFC allows control registries to operate without explicit sovereign auditability requirements.

### Reasoning
Customs authorities must retain the ability to audit systems asserting ownership or control over trade documents to enforce trade law effectively.

### Risk
- Inability for authorities to verify document lineage.
- Enforcement gaps in customs compliance.
- Reduced institutional trust in digital trade systems.

### Recommendation
- Require registries asserting control to be auditable by relevant authorities.
- Establish minimum governance and operational transparency standards.

---

## 9. Conclusion

Interoperability should not be achieved by removing jurisdictional anchors from trust. Instead, the RFC should adopt a federated sovereignty model: interoperable systems connected through mutually recognized sovereign trust frameworks that preserve legal enforceability, operational interoperability, and long-term cryptographic resilience.
